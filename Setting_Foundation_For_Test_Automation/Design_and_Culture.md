# Automation Testing and Strategies

## 1. Reduce the Regression Cycle

Regression testing ensures that recent code changes haven't adversely affected existing functionalities. Automation of regression tests speeds up this process, reducing the time taken for each testing cycle.

## 2. Reduce Technical Debt

Automation can help in identifying and fixing technical debt by continuously running tests for code quality, ensuring that new features or fixes don't add to the existing debt.

## 3. Enable Continuous Testing

Continuous testing integrates automated tests throughout the development process, allowing for faster feedback loops and ensuring that any issues are caught early in the development cycle.

## 4. Dev Vs Tester

In automation testing, collaboration between developers and testers is crucial. Developers write unit tests, while testers focus on higher-level functional and integration tests. Both work together to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## 5. What is a Scenario

A scenario is a sequence of steps that describe a specific user interaction with the system. In automation testing, scenarios are automated to simulate real-world user behaviors and validate the system's functionality.

## 6. Build

Building refers to the process of creating the automation test scripts and frameworks. It involves selecting appropriate tools, designing test cases, and writing the actual code for automation.

## 7. Execution

Execution involves running the automated tests against the application or system under test. It includes scheduling tests, monitoring their progress, and analyzing test results for any failures.

## 8. Culture of the Scrum Team for Testing

In a Scrum team, fostering a culture of testing involves promoting collaboration, transparency, and accountability among team members. Test automation should be seen as a shared responsibility, with everyone contributing to building and maintaining test suites.
